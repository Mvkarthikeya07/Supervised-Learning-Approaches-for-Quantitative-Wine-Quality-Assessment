🍷 Supervised Learning Approaches for Quantitative Wine Quality Assessment

A Machine Learning–Based Quality Assessment Web Application

📌 Overview

The Wine Quality Prediction System is a machine learning–powered web application designed to predict the quality score of red wine based on its physicochemical properties.

The project integrates data preprocessing, model training, serialization, and real-time inference into a complete end-to-end system. It demonstrates how supervised machine learning models can be applied to quality assessment and decision support tasks using a clean and modular software architecture.

🎯 Objectives

🧠 Machine Learning Approach

This project follows a supervised learning regression pipeline.

Methodology

Dataset

Red wine quality dataset containing physicochemical attributes

Each sample is labeled with a quality score

Data Preprocessing

Feature selection and normalization

Handling numerical attributes for regression modeling

Model Training

Regression model trained to predict wine quality score

Model performance evaluated during training phase

Model Persistence

Trained model serialized using pickle for reuse

Prediction

User-provided input features are passed to the trained model

Model outputs a predicted wine quality score

This pipeline ensures accuracy, consistency, and reproducibility.
